# text-to-speak
This code allows you to input a string from the computer and have it spoken out loud using the Windows Speech API (SAPI). It utilizes the __win32com.client__ module to access the SAPI functionality. The code creates an instance of the **SpVoice** object, which is responsible for converting text into speech. Inside a __while__ loop, the code prompts you to enter a string that you want the computer to speak. If you enter 'q', the loop breaks and the program terminates. Otherwise, the entered string is passed to the **Speak()** method of the __SpVoice__ object, which converts the text into speech and plays it through the computer's audio output.
